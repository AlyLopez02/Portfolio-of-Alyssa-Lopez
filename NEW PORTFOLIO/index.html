                        My name is Alyssa Lopez and I am an aspiring web page developer. I recently decided to change
                        career paths but am already putting in the work to follow my new dream. My previous career path
                        was related to law enforcement and as such, I have an Associate's Degree in Criminal Justice.
                        Moving back to the present, I am currently participating in Rutger's Coding Boot Camp to learn
                        what I need to know to become a web page developer. Below you will see the projects I have
                        completed while in the program thus far. Before you look at them, let's learn a little more
                        about me outside of work!

                        <br><br>

                        My hobbies include crochet, knitting, reading, and playing video games. I love creating things,
                        from stuffed animals to scarves! Meanwhile, I also love the way books enable one to enter
                        another world simply by reading a page. I find that books increase my vocabulary as well as my
                        imagination! Finally, I find playing video games a great way to learn teamwork, strategy, and
                        communication. They make those three lessons extremely entertaining to undertake so it is a
                        win-win to me!
